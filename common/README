The thegloaming alarm clock keeps its config in $SNAP_COMMON/config which
will likely be /var/snap/thegloaming/common/config for you

For development purposes, run alarumd.py from the top directory of the
source tree as ./bin/alarumd.py

For configuration, create a file common/config that looks like this:

port: 8080
netatmo:
  client_id: 'XXX REGISTER AT NETATMO AS DEVELOPER FOR THIS XXX'
  client_secret: 'XXX COMES FROM NETATMO WHEN REGISTERED XXX'
  username: 'XXX email address for your persona netatmo account'
  password: 'XXX password for netatmo account'
  station_id: '70:ee:50:xx:xx:xx the mac of your netatmo station'
ows:
  app: 'OpenWeatherMap AppID'
  city: 'XXX OpenWeatherMap CityID'
